In this path you have to save your configuration files.
You have to follow the following naming convention. 
One xml file, implementing the ReferenceModel.xsd schema should be named 
referenceModel.xml.
One mxl file, implementing the QueryModel.xsd schema should be named queryModel.xml.
For each experiment XXX experiment you want to perform you have to create two file. 
The first one, implementing the CassandraModel.xsd should be named XXX.cm.xml while
the second one, implementing the QueryImplementation.xsd should be named XXX.qi.xml.

An example of structure could be
src/main/resources:
-referenceModel.xml
-queryModel.xml
-experiment1.cm.xml
-experiment1.ci.xml
-experiment2.cm.xml
-exteriment2.ci.xml
-.... others xsd. files
